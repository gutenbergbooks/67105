<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time the animals
decided to have a Christmas tree,
and this was how it came about.
The swifts and the swallows in
the chimneys in the country houses,
awakened from their sleep by joy
and laughter, had stolen down
and peeped in upon scenes of
happiness, the centre of which was
always an evergreen tree covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
with wonderful fruit, bright balls
of many colors, and sparkling
threads of gold and silver, lying
like beautiful frost-work among the
green fir needles. A sweet, fairy-like
figure of a Christ-Child or
an angel rested high among the
branches, and underneath the tree
were dolls and sleds and skates
and drums and toys of every sort,
and furs and gloves and tippets,
ribbons and handkerchiefs, and
all the things that boys and girls
need and like; and all about this
tree were gathered always little
children with faces oh! so full
of wonderment and expectation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
changing to radiant, sparkling
merriment as toys and candies
were taken off the tree or from
underneath its boughs and distributed
among them.</p>

<p>The swifts and the swallows told
their feathered friends all about it,
and they told others, both birds
and animals, until at last it began
to be rumored through all the
animal world that on one day in
the year the children of men were
made wonderfully happy by
means of some sort of a festival
which they held about a fir-tree
from the forest. Now, of course
the tame animals and the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
animals, the dogs and the cats and
the mice, knew something more
about this festival. But then, they
did not exchange visits with the
wild animals, because they felt
themselves above them. They
were always trying to be like men
and women, you know, putting on
airs and pretending to know everything;
but after all they were
animals and could not help making
friendships now and then with the
wild creatures, especially when the
men and women were not there.
And when they were asked about
the Christmas tree, they told still
more wonderful stories than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
swifts and the swallows from the
chimneys had told, for some of
them had taken part in these
festivals, and some had even received
presents from the tree, just
like the children. They said that
the tree was called a Christmas
tree, because that strange fruit
and that wonderful frosting came
on it only in the Christmas time,
and that the Christmas time was
the time when men and women and
little children, too, were always
kind and good and loving and gave
things to one another; and they
said, moreover, that on the Christmas
tree grew the things which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
everyone wanted and which would
make them happy, and that it was
so, because in the Christmas time
everyone was trying to make everyone
else happy and to think of
what other people would like.
This they said was what they had
seen and heard told about Christmas
trees. They did not quite
understand why it was so but they
knew that the Christmas tree,
when rightly made, brought the
Christmas spirit, and they had
heard men say that the Christmas
spirit was the great thing, and that
that was what made everyone
happy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>Well, the long and the short of it
was that the animals talked of it
in their dens and on their roosts,
in the fields and in the forests, wild
beasts and tame alike&mdash;the cows
and horses in their stalls, the sheep
in their fold, the doves in their
cotes, and the poultry in the poultry
yard, until all agreed that a Christmas
tree would be a grand thing
for wild and tame alike. Like the
men they, too, would have a tree
of their very own. But how to do
it?</p>

<p>Then the lion called a meeting of
all the creatures, wild and tame,
for you know the lion is king of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
beasts and when he calls they all
must come. You know, too, that
before and during and after these
animal congresses, there is a royal
peace. The lamb can come to the
meeting and sit down by the wolf,
and the wolf dare not touch him;
the dove may perch on the bough
between the hawk and the owl and
neither will harm him, when the
great king of beasts has summoned
them all together to take counsel.
But you know all about the rules
of the animals, for you have read
them in books, and you have seen
the pictures: how the lion sits on
his throne with a crown on one side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
of his head, and all the other
creatures gather about&mdash;the elephant,
and giraffe, the hippopotamus,
the buffalo, wolves and tigers
and leopards, foxes and deer, goats
and sheep, monkeys and orang-outangs,
parrots and robins and
turkeys and swans and storks and
eagles and frogs and lizards and
alligators, and all the rest besides.</p>

<p>Then, when the lion had called
the meeting to order, the swifts
and the swallows told what they
had seen, and a fat little pug-dog,
with a ribbon and a silver bell
about his neck, wheezed out a
story of a Christmas tree that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
had seen, and how a silver bell had
grown on that tree for him and a
whole box of the best sweets he
had ever dreamed of while he
lay comfortably snoozing on his
cushion before the fire. And a
Persian cat, with her hair turned
the wrong way, mewed out her
story of a Christmas tree that she
had attended, and how there was a
white mouse made of cream cheese
for her creeping about beneath
the branches.</p>

<p>Then the monkeys chattered
and the elephants trumpeted, the
horses neighed, the hyenas laughed,
and each in its own way argued for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
a Christmas tree and told what
they would do to help to make it.
The elephant would go into the
forest and choose the tree and pull
it up. The buffaloes would drag
it in. The giraffe would fix the
ornaments on the higher limbs,
because its neck was long. The
monkeys would scramble up where
the giraffe could not reach. The
squirrels could run out on the slender
twigs and help the monkeys.
The birds would fly about and
get the golden threads and put
them on the tree with their beaks.
The fire-flies would hide themselves
among the branches and sparkle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
like diamonds, and the glow-worms
promised to help the fire-flies by
playing candles, if someone would
lift them up and put them on the
branches. The parrots and paroquets
and other birds of gay
plumage would give feathers to
hang among the branches, and the
humming-birds promised to flutter
in and out among the twigs, and
the sheep to give white wool to lie
like snow among the boughs.</p>

<p>Then the parrots screeched and
the peacocks screamed with delight,
and you and I never could have
told whether anybody voted aye
or nay; but the lion knew and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
owl, for he was clerk, set it down
in the minutes, as the lion bade
him, that all the birds and beasts
would do their part. So each
planned what he could do. Even
the little beetle, who makes great
balls of earth, thought that if he
could only once see one of those
gay balls that grow on the children&#8217;s
Christmas tree, he might
make some for the animals&#8217; tree;
different birds and beasts told of
the oranges and apples and holly-berries
and who knows what they
could get and hang upon the tree.
You see the animals came from
many places, and then, too, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
could send the carrier pigeons to
go and bring fruit and berries, and
who knows what besides, from oh,
so far away, because the carrier
pigeons can fly through the air
no one knows how fast or how far.</p>

<p>Well, I cannot tell you everything
that each one was going to
do, but if you will go and get your
Noah&#8217;s ark and take the animals
out one by one, then you surely
will think it out for yourself, for
you have all the animals there.</p>

<p>And so they arranged how they
would ornament the tree, and the
next thing was to decide what
presents should be hung on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
tree or put beneath its boughs, for
each one must have his present.
Well, after much discussion in
roars, and bellows, crows and
croaks, lows and screams and
bleats, and baas and grunts, and
all the other sounds of bird and
beast language, it was voted that
each might choose the present he
wished hung on the tree. The
clerkly owl should call their names
one by one, and each might declare
his choice. So they began. The
parrots and the macaws thought
that they would like oranges and
bananas and such things, which
would look so pretty on the tree,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
too; and so they were arranged for.
The robins and the cedar birds
chose cherries; the partridges, partridge
berries; the squirrels, red
and gray and black, nuts and
apples and pears. The monkeys
said the popcorn strings would do
for them, and the cats and dogs,
remembering the Christmas gifts
which the pug-dog and Persian cat
had told about, asked for tiny
mice made of cream cheese or
chocolate. By and by it came
the pig&#8217;s turn to tell his choice.
&#8220;Grunt, grunt!&#8221; said the pig, &#8220;I
want a nice pail of swill hung on
the very lowest bough of all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; said the black leopard,
so sleek and so clean.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faugh!&#8221; said the gazelle, with
his dainty sense of smell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neigh!&#8221; said the horse, so
daintily groomed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; roared the lion, &#8220;what&#8217;s
that you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A pail of swill,&#8221; grunted the
pig. &#8220;Each one has chosen what
he wants, and I have a right to
choose what I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; roared the lion, &#8220;each
one has chosen something beautiful
to make the tree a joy to all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grunt, grunt,&#8221; said the pig.
&#8220;The parrots and the macaws are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
going to have oranges and bananas,
and the robins and the cedar birds
red cherries, the partridges their
berries, the squirrels nuts and
apples and pears, the dog and the
cat their cream and chocolate mice.
They all have what they want to
eat. Grunt, grunt,&#8221; said he; &#8220;I
will have what I want to eat, too,
and what I want is a pail of swill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, you see, it had been voted,
as I told you, that each should
choose what he wanted hung on
the tree for him, and so the lion
could not help himself. If the
pig chose swill, swill he must have,
and angrily he had to roar: &#8220;If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the pig wants swill, a pail of swill
he must have, hung on the lowest
bough of the tree!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the wolf&#8217;s wicked eyes
gleamed, for his turn was next, and
he said: &#8220;If the pig has swill because
he wants swill to eat, I
must have what I want to eat, and
I want a tender lamb, six months
old.&#8221; And at that all the lambs
and the sheep bleated and baaed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha!&#8221; barked the fox; &#8220;then
I want a turkey!&#8221; And the turkeys
gobbled in fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; said the tiger, &#8220;want
a yearling calf.&#8221; And the cows
and the calves lowed in horror.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>&#8220;And I,&#8221; said the owl, the clerk,
&#8220;I want a plump dove.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; said the hawk, &#8220;will
take a rabbit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; said the leopard, &#8220;want
a deer or a gazelle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then all was fear and uproar.
The hares and the rabbits scuttled
into the grass; the gazelles and the
deer bounded away; the sheep and
cattle crowded close together; the
small birds rose in the air in flocks;
and the Christmas tree was like
to have come to grief and ended,
not in Christmas joy, but in fear
and hatred and terror.</p>

<p>Then a little timid lamb stepped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
out and bleated: &#8220;Ah! king lion,
it would be very sad if all the
animals should lose their Christmas
tree, for the very thought of
that tree has brought us closer
together, and here we were, wild
and tame, fierce and timid, met
together as friends; and oh! king
lion, rather than there should not
be a tree, they may take me and
hang me on it. Let them not take
the turkeys and gazelles and the
calves and the rabbits, and all the
rest that they have chosen. Let
the tigers and leopards, and wolves
and foxes and eagles, and hawks
and owls and all their kind be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
content that their Christmas present
shall be a lamb; and so we
may come together again and have
our happy Christmas tree, and each
have what he wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said the lion, &#8220;what will
you have? If you give yourself,
then you will have no Christmas
present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the lamb, &#8220;I, too,
shall have what I want, for I shall
have brought them all together
again, and made each one happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a dove fluttered down
from a tree and landed on the
ground beside the lamb, and very
timidly and softly she cooed:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
&#8220;Take me, too, king lion, as the
present for the owls and the hawks,
and the weasels and the minks,
because for them a lamb is too big.
I am the best present for them.
Take me, king lion!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the lion roared: &#8220;See what
the lamb and the dove have done!
My food, oh, tigers and leopards
and wolves and eagles and all your
kind, is like your food; but I would
rather eat nothing from our Christmas
tree than take this lamb or
this dove for my present.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then all the beasts kept still, because
the lion roared so loud and
angrily, and the birds that were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
flying away settled on the branches
of the trees, and the gazelles
stopped their running and turned
their heads to listen, and the
rabbits peeped out through the
grass and brush where they had
hid. Then the lion turned to the
pig, and roared:</p>

<p>&#8220;See this lamb and this dove!
Are you not ashamed for what you
have done? You have spoiled all
our happiness. Will you take
back your choice, you pig, or do
you wish to ruin our Christmas
tree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grunt, grunt,&#8221; said the pig,
&#8220;it is my right. I want something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
good. I don&#8217;t care for your lambs
and your doves. I want my swill!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the lion roared again:
&#8220;Have all chosen?&#8221; and all answered,
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the lion, &#8220;it is my
choice.&#8221;</p>

<p>And all said: &#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love fat and tender pigs. I
choose a pig for my Christmas
gift,&#8221; roared the lion.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear a pig squeal?
Oh, how that pig squealed then!
And he got up on his fat little legs
and tried to run away, but all the
animals gathered around in a ring
and the hyenas laughed, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
jackals cried, and the dogs and the
wolves and the foxes headed him
off, and hunted the poor pig back
again. Then, when the pig found
that he could not run away, he lay
down on his back with his feet in
the air and squealed with all his
might: &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want the swill;
oh, I don&#8217;t want the swill! I take it
all back! I don&#8217;t want anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>But at first no one heard him,
because all were talking at once in
their own way&mdash;barking and growling
and roaring and chattering; but
by and by the lion saw that the
pig was squealing something, so he
roared for silence, and then they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
all heard the pig squeal out that
he did not want any swill. And
the lion roared aloud: &#8220;You have
heard. Has the owl recorded that
the pig will have no swill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the owl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the lion, &#8220;record
that the lion wants no pig.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the tiger growled: &#8220;And
I want no calf,&#8221; and one by one
the leopard and the eagle, the wolf
and the fox, the hawk and the owl,
and all their kind, took back their
votes.</p>

<p>And so it came about that the
animals did have a Christmas tree
after all; but instead of hanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
lambs and doves upon the tree,
they agreed that they could hang
little images of lambs and doves,
and other birds and animals, too,
perhaps. And by and by the
custom spread until the humans
came to hang the same little images
on their trees, too, and when you
see a little figure of a lamb or a
dove on the Christmas tree, you
may know that it is all because
the lamb and the dove, by their
unselfishness, saved the animals
from strife; for neither thought
what he wanted from the tree, but
each was ready to give himself for
the others, so that they might not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
fight and kill one another at the
Christmas time.</p>

<p>Was it not cruel of the wolves
and tigers and leopards and foxes
to wish to eat the doves and sheep
and rabbits and hares? But after
all, the worst one of the lot, I think,
was the pig; for the pig began the
trouble, because he only thought of
what Mr. Pig wanted for himself.</p>

<p>And do you know, I think that
after all that is the trouble everywhere.
We can get along all right
if the pig will only keep away, for
when the pig comes and begins to
think what he can get for himself,
without thinking of the pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
and the comfort of anyone else,
why, then the fun is all spoiled, and
pretty soon all sorts of bad tempers
and bad passions are let loose.</p>
