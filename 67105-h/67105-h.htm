<p>Originally published in the

little fable has been so often asked

it has been thought best to give it
a wider publicity by re-issuing in
its present form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time the animals
decided to have a Christmas tree,
and this was how it came about.
The swifts and the swallows in
the chimneys in the country houses,
awakened from their sleep by joy
and laughter, had stolen down
and peeped in upon scenes of
happiness, the centre of which was
always an evergreen tree covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
with wonderful fruit, bright balls
of many colors, and sparkling
threads of gold and silver, lying
like beautiful frost-work among the
green fir needles. A sweet, fairy-like
figure of a Christ-Child or
an angel rested high among the
branches, and underneath the tree
were dolls and sleds and skates
and drums and toys of every sort,
and furs and gloves and tippets,
ribbons and handkerchiefs, and
all the things that boys and girls
need and like; and all about this
tree were gathered always little
children with faces oh! so full
of wonderment and expectation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
changing to radiant, sparkling
merriment as toys and candies
were taken off the tree or from
underneath its boughs and distributed
among them.</p>

<p>The swifts and the swallows told
their feathered friends all about it,
and they told others, both birds
and animals, until at last it began
to be rumored through all the
animal world that on one day in
the year the children of men were
made wonderfully happy by
means of some sort of a festival
which they held about a fir-tree
from the forest. Now, of course
the tame animals and the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
animals, the dogs and the cats and
the mice, knew something more
about this festival. But then, they
did not exchange visits with the
wild animals, because they felt
themselves above them. They
were always trying to be like men
and women, you know, putting on
airs and pretending to know everything;
but after all they were
animals and could not help making
friendships now and then with the
wild creatures, especially when the
men and women were not there.
And when they were asked about
the Christmas tree, they told still
more wonderful stories than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
swifts and the swallows from the
chimneys had told, for some of
them had taken part in these
festivals, and some had even received
presents from the tree, just
like the children. They said that
the tree was called a Christmas
tree, because that strange fruit
and that wonderful frosting came
on it only in the Christmas time,
and that the Christmas time was
the time when men and women and
little children, too, were always
kind and good and loving and gave
things to one another; and they
said, moreover, that on the Christmas
tree grew the things which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
everyone wanted and which would
make them happy, and that it was
so, because in the Christmas time
everyone was trying to make everyone
else happy and to think of
what other people would like.
This they said was what they had
seen and heard told about Christmas
trees. They did not quite
understand why it was so but they
knew that the Christmas tree,
when rightly made, brought the
Christmas spirit, and they had
heard men say that the Christmas
spirit was the great thing, and that
that was what made everyone
happy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>Well, the long and the short of it
was that the animals talked of it
in their dens and on their roosts,
in the fields and in the forests, wild
beasts and tame alike&mdash;the cows
and horses in their stalls, the sheep
in their fold, the doves in their
cotes, and the poultry in the poultry
yard, until all agreed that a Christmas
tree would be a grand thing
for wild and tame alike. Like the
men they, too, would have a tree
of their very own. But how to do
it?</p>

<p>Then the lion called a meeting of
all the creatures, wild and tame,
for you know the lion is king of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
beasts and when he calls they all
must come. You know, too, that
before and during and after these
animal congresses, there is a royal
peace. The lamb can come to the
meeting and sit down by the wolf,
and the wolf dare not touch him;
the dove may perch on the bough
between the hawk and the owl and
neither will harm him, when the
great king of beasts has summoned
them all together to take counsel.
But you know all about the rules
of the animals, for you have read
them in books, and you have seen
the pictures: how the lion sits on
his throne with a crown on one side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
of his head, and all the other
creatures gather about&mdash;the elephant,
and giraffe, the hippopotamus,
the buffalo, wolves and tigers
and leopards, foxes and deer, goats
and sheep, monkeys and orang-outangs,
parrots and robins and
turkeys and swans and storks and
eagles and frogs and lizards and
alligators, and all the rest besides.</p>

<p>Then, when the lion had called
the meeting to order, the swifts
and the swallows told what they
had seen, and a fat little pug-dog,
with a ribbon and a silver bell
about his neck, wheezed out a
story of a Christmas tree that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
had seen, and how a silver bell had
grown on that tree for him and a
whole box of the best sweets he
had ever dreamed of while he
lay comfortably snoozing on his
cushion before the fire. And a
Persian cat, with her hair turned
the wrong way, mewed out her
story of a Christmas tree that she
had attended, and how there was a
white mouse made of cream cheese
for her creeping about beneath
the branches.</p>

<p>Then the monkeys chattered
and the elephants trumpeted, the
horses neighed, the hyenas laughed,
and each in its own way argued for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
a Christmas tree and told what
they would do to help to make it.
The elephant would go into the
forest and choose the tree and pull
it up. The buffaloes would drag
it in. The giraffe would fix the
ornaments on the higher limbs,
because its neck was long. The
monkeys would scramble up where
the giraffe could not reach. The
squirrels could run out on the slender
twigs and help the monkeys.
The birds would fly about and
get the golden threads and put
them on the tree with their beaks.
The fire-flies would hide themselves
among the branches and sparkle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
like diamonds, and the glow-worms
promised to help the fire-flies by
playing candles, if someone would
lift them up and put them on the
branches. The parrots and paroquets
and other birds of gay
plumage would give feathers to
hang among the branches, and the
humming-birds promised to flutter
in and out among the twigs, and
the sheep to give white wool to lie
like snow among the boughs.</p>

<p>Then the parrots screeched and
the peacocks screamed with delight,
and you and I never could have
told whether anybody voted aye
or nay; but the lion knew and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
owl, for he was clerk, set it down
in the minutes, as the lion bade
him, that all the birds and beasts
would do their part. So each
planned what he could do. Even
the little beetle, who makes great
balls of earth, thought that if he
could only once see one of those
gay balls that grow on the children&#8217;s
Christmas tree, he might
make some for the animals&#8217; tree;
different birds and beasts told of
the oranges and apples and holly-berries
and who knows what they
could get and hang upon the tree.
You see the animals came from
many places, and then, too, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
could send the carrier pigeons to
go and bring fruit and berries, and
who knows what besides, from oh,
so far away, because the carrier
pigeons can fly through the air
no one knows how fast or how far.</p>

<p>Well, I cannot tell you everything
that each one was going to
do, but if you will go and get your
Noah&#8217;s ark and take the animals
out one by one, then you surely
will think it out for yourself, for
you have all the animals there.</p>

<p>And so they arranged how they
would ornament the tree, and the
next thing was to decide what
presents should be hung on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
tree or put beneath its boughs, for
each one must have his present.
Well, after much discussion in
roars, and bellows, crows and
croaks, lows and screams and
bleats, and baas and grunts, and
all the other sounds of bird and
beast language, it was voted that
each might choose the present he
wished hung on the tree. The
clerkly owl should call their names
one by one, and each might declare
his choice. So they began. The
parrots and the macaws thought
that they would like oranges and
bananas and such things, which
would look so pretty on the tree,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
too; and so they were arranged for.
The robins and the cedar birds
chose cherries; the partridges, partridge
berries; the squirrels, red
and gray and black, nuts and
apples and pears. The monkeys
said the popcorn strings would do
for them, and the cats and dogs,
remembering the Christmas gifts
which the pug-dog and Persian cat
had told about, asked for tiny
mice made of cream cheese or
chocolate. By and by it came
the pig&#8217;s turn to tell his choice.
&#8220;Grunt, grunt!&#8221; said the pig, &#8220;I
want a nice pail of swill hung on
the very lowest bough of all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; said the black leopard,
so sleek and so clean.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faugh!&#8221; said the gazelle, with
his dainty sense of smell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neigh!&#8221; said the horse, so
daintily groomed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; roared the lion, &#8220;what&#8217;s
that you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A pail of swill,&#8221; grunted the
pig. &#8220;Each one has chosen what
he wants, and I have a right to
choose what I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; roared the lion, &#8220;each
one has chosen something beautiful
to make the tree a joy to all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grunt, grunt,&#8221; said the pig.
&#8220;The parrots and the macaws are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
going to have oranges and bananas,
and the robins and the cedar birds
red cherries, the partridges their
berries, the squirrels nuts and
apples and pears, the dog and the
cat their cream and chocolate mice.
They all have what they want to
eat. Grunt, grunt,&#8221; said he; &#8220;I
will have what I want to eat, too,
and what I want is a pail of swill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, you see, it had been voted,
as I told you, that each should
choose what he wanted hung on
the tree for him, and so the lion
could not help himself. If the
pig chose swill, swill he must have,
and angrily he had to roar: &#8220;If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the pig wants swill, a pail of swill
he must have, hung on the lowest
bough of the tree!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the wolf&#8217;s wicked eyes
gleamed, for his turn was next, and
he said: &#8220;If the pig has swill because
he wants swill to eat, I
must have what I want to eat, and
I want a tender lamb, six months
old.&#8221; And at that all the lambs
and the sheep bleated and baaed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha!&#8221; barked the fox; &#8220;then
I want a turkey!&#8221; And the turkeys
gobbled in fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; said the tiger, &#8220;want
a yearling calf.&#8221; And the cows
and the calves lowed in horror.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>&#8220;And I,&#8221; said the owl, the clerk,
&#8220;I want a plump dove.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; said the hawk, &#8220;will
take a rabbit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; said the leopard, &#8220;want
a deer or a gazelle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then all was fear and uproar.
The hares and the rabbits scuttled
into the grass; the gazelles and the
deer bounded away; the sheep and
cattle crowded close together; the
small birds rose in the air in flocks;
and the Christmas tree was like
to have come to grief and ended,
not in Christmas joy, but in fear
and hatred and terror.</p>

<p>Then a little timid lamb stepped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
out and bleated: &#8220;Ah! king lion,
it would be very sad if all the
animals should lose their Christmas
tree, for the very thought of
that tree has brought us closer
together, and here we were, wild
and tame, fierce and timid, met
together as friends; and oh! king
lion, rather than there should not
be a tree, they may take me and
hang me on it. Let them not take
the turkeys and gazelles and the
calves and the rabbits, and all the
rest that they have chosen. Let
the tigers and leopards, and wolves
and foxes and eagles, and hawks
and owls and all their kind be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
content that their Christmas present
shall be a lamb; and so we
may come together again and have
our happy Christmas tree, and each
have what he wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said the lion, &#8220;what will
you have? If you give yourself,
then you will have no Christmas
present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the lamb, &#8220;I, too,
shall have what I want, for I shall
have brought them all together
again, and made each one happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a dove fluttered down
from a tree and landed on the
ground beside the lamb, and very
timidly and softly she cooed:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
&#8220;Take me, too, king lion, as the
present for the owls and the hawks,
and the weasels and the minks,
because for them a lamb is too big.
I am the best present for them.
Take me, king lion!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the lion roared: &#8220;See what
the lamb and the dove have done!
My food, oh, tigers and leopards
and wolves and eagles and all your
kind, is like your food; but I would
rather eat nothing from our Christmas
tree than take this lamb or
this dove for my present.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then all the beasts kept still, because
the lion roared so loud and
angrily, and the birds that were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
flying away settled on the branches
of the trees, and the gazelles
stopped their running and turned
their heads to listen, and the
rabbits peeped out through the
grass and brush where they had
hid. Then the lion turned to the
pig, and roared:</p>

<p>&#8220;See this lamb and this dove!
Are you not ashamed for what you
have done? You have spoiled all
our happiness. Will you take
back your choice, you pig, or do
you wish to ruin our Christmas
tree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grunt, grunt,&#8221; said the pig,
&#8220;it is my right. I want something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
good. I don&#8217;t care for your lambs
and your doves. I want my swill!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the lion roared again:
&#8220;Have all chosen?&#8221; and all answered,
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the lion, &#8220;it is my
choice.&#8221;</p>

<p>And all said: &#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love fat and tender pigs. I
choose a pig for my Christmas
gift,&#8221; roared the lion.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear a pig squeal?
Oh, how that pig squealed then!
And he got up on his fat little legs
and tried to run away, but all the
animals gathered around in a ring
and the hyenas laughed, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
jackals cried, and the dogs and the
wolves and the foxes headed him
off, and hunted the poor pig back
again. Then, when the pig found
that he could not run away, he lay
down on his back with his feet in
the air and squealed with all his
might: &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want the swill;
oh, I don&#8217;t want the swill! I take it
all back! I don&#8217;t want anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>But at first no one heard him,
because all were talking at once in
their own way&mdash;barking and growling
and roaring and chattering; but
by and by the lion saw that the
pig was squealing something, so he
roared for silence, and then they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
all heard the pig squeal out that
he did not want any swill. And
the lion roared aloud: &#8220;You have
heard. Has the owl recorded that
the pig will have no swill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the owl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the lion, &#8220;record
that the lion wants no pig.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the tiger growled: &#8220;And
I want no calf,&#8221; and one by one
the leopard and the eagle, the wolf
and the fox, the hawk and the owl,
and all their kind, took back their
votes.</p>

<p>And so it came about that the
animals did have a Christmas tree
after all; but instead of hanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
lambs and doves upon the tree,
they agreed that they could hang
little images of lambs and doves,
and other birds and animals, too,
perhaps. And by and by the
custom spread until the humans
came to hang the same little images
on their trees, too, and when you
see a little figure of a lamb or a
dove on the Christmas tree, you
may know that it is all because
the lamb and the dove, by their
unselfishness, saved the animals
from strife; for neither thought
what he wanted from the tree, but
each was ready to give himself for
the others, so that they might not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
fight and kill one another at the
Christmas time.</p>

<p>Was it not cruel of the wolves
and tigers and leopards and foxes
to wish to eat the doves and sheep
and rabbits and hares? But after
all, the worst one of the lot, I think,
was the pig; for the pig began the
trouble, because he only thought of
what Mr. Pig wanted for himself.</p>

<p>And do you know, I think that
after all that is the trouble everywhere.
We can get along all right
if the pig will only keep away, for
when the pig comes and begins to
think what he can get for himself,
without thinking of the pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
and the comfort of anyone else,
why, then the fun is all spoiled, and
pretty soon all sorts of bad tempers
and bad passions are let loose.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
